Code for the blog post [Declarative Beats Imperative: Transforming Data In JavaScript](https://wondersofcode.wordpress.com/2015/03/13/declarative-beats-imperative-transforming-data-in-javascript/)

An example of a imperative vs. declarative data transformation in JavaScript.
The declarative one makes the target data form visible and is thus easier to understand
and also makes it possible to add additional processing such as creating an audit log
of the data transformation.

Run `node main.js` to see both transformations in action. See `imperative-transformer.js` and `declarative-transformer.js` for the code.
